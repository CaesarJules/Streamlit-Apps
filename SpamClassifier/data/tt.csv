"Still hasn't shipped yet after a week. I will update a review on the actual unit when /if I receive it. For now, 3 stars because of the horrific customer service. Unbelievably bad. I am still quite skeptical about this purchase, as I've never heard of the brand. We will see how it goes.",verified
"I wanted something new but different and trendy. We all use mobiles now but at times we need a landline in our office. During my travels to Asia, Australia and Europe in the last 1-year, I wondered how come they have such stylish designs of phones, vibrant colors etc. and we do not have them in California? I went to 3 largest electronics stores here and found a ton of AT&T, RCA, Motorola, GE, Panasonic etc. but same old designs with minor changes and unnecessary features no one uses anyways! Upon researching Amazon, found many good items and loved this one. Color is Ivory (awesome classy!), has a smooth satin matt finish, elegant design and works perfect and the look and feel is very European. Like the other buyer here said in another review, the phone gets noticed immediately and people ask the brand name and model. Comes with a belt clip on handset. Sound is very clear and speaker function works for conferences and does not give any hollow echo. Worth a try!",verified
"These batteries absolutely will NOT fit a Garmin 650 as stated. The Garmin 650 uses a 2 wire connector and this is a 3 wire connector. DO NOT BUY this Product if you are trying to replace the battery in a Garmin 650 it is a waste of time. Also the will not answer the phone or reply to emails. Sometimes low price means it is junk. Also these are Li-Po batteries, Garmin uses Li-Ion in there units. I am stuck with 2 batteries I will never use unless I can find a device that uses a 3 wire connector.",verified
"So far is working fine, hopefully the cord won't break- it looks great, well made, it seems much better that the one I ordered before from a different  provider",verified
Rather bulky.,verified
"I ordered this car charger for my husband's truck after I purchased the same charger for myself at a local big box store for 3 times as much.  The charger arrived very fast, within 3 days after I ordered.  The product is the same (minus the elaborate packaging) as I purchased.<br /><br />I love this charger.  It fits into the cigarette lighter and you can't tell it is there.  Any  device that uses a usb plug in for charging can use it. It also has two ports for plug-ins so I can charge my phone at the same time as my son has his ITouch charging. Thanks Amazon!",verified
I did not get anything!!!!!!!,verified
"$7.99 for a sticker plus $5.99 for shipping in a simple envelope!!! Way, way overpriced.!!! If it was not for my daughter, I would have sent it back and asked for double the price in return. Do not waste your money on this cheap junk!!!",verified
"AppRadio 3 review:<br />Radio is great. Have to buy some extra parts, but if you dont like it - then buy cheaper option.<br /><br />BuyBuyDigital review:<br />Item serial number was ripped off. Missing instruction manual. Item would not work. Returned via Amazon Prime (always use them so I wont have to deal directly with vendor). Just ordered another unit from a different seller via Amazon Prime.",verified
Does what it says. You do need to push past the broken English instructions to set it up but after that it works wonderfully. A little calibration is in order as well I suppose. But I'm happy with it so far we'll see over the next few days..,verified
This is a great cd holder. I use it for my games and it truly protect it all the way and i accidentally stepped on it and all games were perfectly fine. I totally recommend it :D,verified
DO NOT BUY this is a piece of junk. I could never get it to work. you know the saying you get what you pay for. Don't waste your time.,verified
"My biggest complaint about this case is it has no hole for a person to be able to plug in their head phones. I don't use bluetooth headphones and don't plan to either. There should be a hole..lol. I just don't get why there isn't... makes no sense. Plus, the tray that you place your ipod in doesn't keep it secure especially when you open it up. It can and does slide around easily which can and will cause scratches on the back. Would be better if it had a clip down design.    I just recently bought an Ipod touch 4th generation. It's seems there's not much of a selection of leather flip type cases right now that aren't expensive. I mean I can see how buying something that costs 30 bucks to protect your ipod might be worth it considering how much the ipods are... it would be a good investment (mostly). Although, in my mind at times, I go back to it just being a case to protect my ipod, so it's hard to justify on spending that much money. I want something that keeps my touch safe from being shattered or scraped if it were to drop on the floor. Also I wanted something that didn't make it obvious that I was carrying an ipod touch around... Something that won't cause damage to it while protecting it either. I guess I really couldn't expect much from a 9 dollar item. I already looked else where on amazon and bought a completely different and better designed leather flip case for 20 dollars.",verified
Wonderful bargain... they are work and wear as promised... works as replacement part --great.<br />I would definitely buy them again and again.<br />thank you!,verified
Does the job..Keeps sun glare down.This clip on shade is good for all 5&#34; GPS screens.Metal wire covered in a silicone tube used<br />so it will not melt or warp.As others are cheap plastic that will warp and loose its grip and may fall off.,verified
Best price I found on the internet for this item.  I used to repair a friends broken bracket.  This bracket is better than original equipment.,verified
Case arrived promptly and in new condition.  Case was as I expected.  I now have a convenience and safe place to store my nano and earbuds!,verified
I pad and I phone keep getting message it is not Apple product and you have to unplug and plug again for it to work. Very dissatisfied just ordered two Apple cords.,verified
I would buy this again!! The worked and are still in use today.For the money I think they are a great value~~,verified
Great product. It is amazing all the things you can do with it. Alot included for the price.,verified
Just what we wanted. Thanks!,verified
It's a little complicated to put the ipod inside the band. After that it's confortable use it to workout or to go climbing,verified
I love this mini speaker it is so awesome thank you ever so much I be back to buy my next item thank you again,verified
The Oontz has deservedly good reviews for sound quality so I am just posting a few nitpicks.<br /><br />1) There was a report on Don Lindich's blog that they had redesigned the logo. As of today they are still shipping out the old ugly one.<br /><br />2) The blue light is really annoying to me. Anyone have any good fixes?<br /><br />3) They are using a mini USB charging port in a world dominated by micro USB charged phones. One more thing to carry.<br /><br />4) Makes an audible popping noise about 10 secs after the music stops playing. Probably some sort of disconnection for energy saving.<br /><br />Nothing earth shattering but the difference between a good and excellent product.,not_verified
Works well!,verified
It was really good in fact I got an extra one so I have 2. It's really useful and it's really cheap and works well,verified
My daughter has an iTouch and loves to switch the cover based on her outfit and her mood!  These fit great and are easy to change.,verified
"Works perfectly, paired right up with my Galaxy SIII and works great in my 2008 Denali and my 2008 Accord V6.<br /><br />I didn't use the CD and it came with no printed instructions, but if you are buying this and don't know how to pair something with bluetooth to your phone... then you should consider another product.<br /><br />Read and cleared codes flawlessly<br /><br />I use the Torque app for android",verified
These are great quality speakers and small enough to take with you anywhere.  They are easy to sync (though it doesn't tell you how to turn it on and off since the instructions are a simple sheet using caveman sign language).  You have to figure it out on your own.,verified
"I bought this adapter to allow the phone to charge and use atthe same time.  I was wrong.  Doesnt work at all, never charges.",verified
"Arrived as promise, just what I wanted. Thank you",verified
"First let me say that the supplier send me a complete two page (8 X 11) set of instructions and apologized for the bad instructions sent with the unit. This arrived before the unite! Yes there were some mistakes in his better instructions so I re-wrote them and sent him a copy. That's what I do. . .  write instructions! Well I was still not ready for what I heard out of the unit! The setup is simple and the new instructions clear! Let me say for those reading this that I'm 83 and may not listen to the same music that most buyers will want to listen to, but the tone is there and the highs and mid range is as well. The bass could be a little bit more but will do. Now I have it connected to my computer out and listen to all manor of music from Glenn Miller to The 1812 to jazz. No there are not Hi Fi super stereo! But they are stereo and reproduce a wide spectrum of sound. As I said the unit is connect to the output on the back of my computer. Most computers today that are PC have a Realtek sound Manager program. In control Panel you will find the listing and be able to adjust your playback. Set it to 5.1 and check the 'subwoofer' option. Next use the 'Environment' settings i.e. 'Auditorium' and the Equalizer option setting i.e. 'Rock' ! Next right click on the program and make a 'desktop' shortcut so you can change setting as you change music. Lastly I lost me &#34;c&#34; drive two days after receiving the unit so while waiting I plugged the unit into my Samsung TAB 2 10.1 and the sound and level was almost as good. You may find that the line cable that plugs into your computer is a little short, but extensions can be picked up for not that much. I had sitting around an old mixer from Numark and I used the RCA cables that come with the unit and placed it in the middle which gave me the little more cable length needed and a pair of VU meters! Also a volume control as different cuts are recorder at different levels.<br />Anyone wanting to see and hear the units can contact me on Skype at edward.r.fowler1 and I'll demo them for you! Just put in the contact why or I'll not except!",verified
"just what the description described, fast shipping, great product! it's exactly what i needed and i am very happy with this purchase.",not_verified
fits my arm. the pink is cute. have to take off my iphone case but it's no biggie! fastener on the top so it doesn't slip out.,verified
Just got a redcam ticket for $50.  I see that it has to be installed behind the rearview mirror.  Will this interfere with my EZ Pass (tolls) or remote starter?  Thanks...,not_verified
"Wow, a very innovating experience of listening to music, depending on the surface where you place this extremely portable speaker you achieve different sounds (wood works best for me). I highly recommend this speaker, it works as an mp3 player, portable, 5W speaker, and rechargeable battery lasts about 10 hours.",verified
I'm not the best at putting these on but it worked well for my Note and his Tab. With one to spare!,verified
"In looking for charging cables for my iphone 5s, I found a ton of reviews indicating problems with the new IOS 7 and any cable that wasn't purchased directly form apple, so I was hesitant to purchase a non-apple brand charger at first.  I figured I'd take a shot, and for $11, this one seemed like a relatively safe bet and I didn't really have anything to lose.  I'm glad to say it lived up to my expectations, and exceeded them!  The shipping was FAST, it got here in perfect condition, and it works PERFECTLY.  The 9 ft cable was initially something I didn't care too much about, but has actually turned out to be incredibly useful.<br /><br />Definitely 5 star-worthy and HIGHLY recommended to anyone looking for a more cost-effective alternative to their iphone 5 charger!",verified
"I bought this with the thought of using my Android device(s) with a logitech speaker that was tailored for iDevices.  The \\""works pretty well\\"" title of the review is the summary.  I am able to use this with most of my Android devices, but audio won't play on *the* one I wanted it to work on.  Not a big deal though since I can just use the headphone jack to the speaker's line in and all is well.  The thing I really do like about it is that I can still use it on ALL of my Android devices to charge them since they all use a micro usb to charge.",verified
These things are as good as the Apple branded product at a fraction of the price.,verified
"The case looks nice, but there is no way this case can protect the phone. It is flimsy and thin, and the sides do not come up high enough to protect the screen so a screen protector is a must.  Also the cell and wifi signal strength dropped significantly when the case was on the phone.  I do not recommend this product.",verified
i was so happy to get these there super cute and a great deal only issues is no holes were the bottons are so they tend to stick ad are hard to press,verified
"I don't have a ton of experience with this product yet.  There is a Halloween party in our church parking lot every year.  Everyone decorates their cars with lights and other scary stuff.  Typically, my wife just powers the lights with her car battery and kills her battery over the course of the 3 hour party.  It's never a good idea to completely kill your car battery as it never takes a full charge after a complete drain.  Right after I got this goal0 battery and inverter I gave it to my wife to use to power the Halloween lights on her car for the party.  Worked great and powered all of the lights for the full 3 hours and still had power left.  I have also used it to power my laptop and phone for a few hours and still had over half of the battery life left.  Now I just leave it plugged in and tucked away in case of an emergency where I need power for small electronics and appliances.  The inverter does use an internal fan to cool itself and it is a slight bit noisy.  Nothing you couldn't sleep with if you had to though.",verified
great product,verified
"This wire sucks, it has a very thick jacket but thats it. The wire inside is about the same as my JL 4 gauge. The Cadence 0 Gauge I bought is easily 2-3 times thicker then this is. U'd be better off buying Flex-a-prene or ultra-flex welding cable than this stuff for 3&change p/f.",verified
"Pretty cheap,  works but low quality",verified
Quality product comes with outstanding customer service.,not_verified
"It's okay, but the nook is only secured by this little piece of elastic which kinda blocks with the page number or the menu button. Other than that, it works well.",verified
Ok im going to make this short and sweet! I loved this! it worked great it came in really fast and it came exactly as described. I went on amazon and bought myself a phone holder and now I put it in my car and it sounds great! the control could be a little better made but seriously for 6 bucks its a steal plus with the 2 dollars in the holder i made a great buy! I would definetly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a cheap way to listen to music in their car or even at home on any radio.,verified
