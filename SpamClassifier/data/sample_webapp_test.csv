"Still hasn't shipped yet after a week. I will update a review on the actual unit when /if I receive it. For now, 3 stars because of the horrific customer service. Unbelievably bad. I am still quite skeptical about this purchase, as I've never heard of the brand. We will see how it goes.",verified
"I wanted something new but different and trendy. We all use mobiles now but at times we need a landline in our office. During my travels to Asia, Australia and Europe in the last 1-year, I wondered how come they have such stylish designs of phones, vibrant colors etc. and we do not have them in California? I went to 3 largest electronics stores here and found a ton of AT&T, RCA, Motorola, GE, Panasonic etc. but same old designs with minor changes and unnecessary features no one uses anyways! Upon researching Amazon, found many good items and loved this one. Color is Ivory (awesome classy!), has a smooth satin matt finish, elegant design and works perfect and the look and feel is very European. Like the other buyer here said in another review, the phone gets noticed immediately and people ask the brand name and model. Comes with a belt clip on handset. Sound is very clear and speaker function works for conferences and does not give any hollow echo. Worth a try!",verified
"These batteries absolutely will NOT fit a Garmin 650 as stated. The Garmin 650 uses a 2 wire connector and this is a 3 wire connector. DO NOT BUY this Product if you are trying to replace the battery in a Garmin 650 it is a waste of time. Also the will not answer the phone or reply to emails. Sometimes low price means it is junk. Also these are Li-Po batteries, Garmin uses Li-Ion in there units. I am stuck with 2 batteries I will never use unless I can find a device that uses a 3 wire connector.",verified
"So far is working fine, hopefully the cord won't break- it looks great, well made, it seems much better that the one I ordered before from a different  provider",verified

"I ordered this car charger for my husband's truck after I purchased the same charger for myself at a local big box store for 3 times as much.  The charger arrived very fast, within 3 days after I ordered.  The product is the same (minus the elaborate packaging) as I purchased.<br /><br />I love this charger.  It fits into the cigarette lighter and you can't tell it is there.  Any  device that uses a usb plug in for charging can use it. It also has two ports for plug-ins so I can charge my phone at the same time as my son has his ITouch charging. Thanks Amazon!",verified

Does what it says. You do need to push past the broken English instructions to set it up but after that it works wonderfully. A little calibration is in order as well I suppose. But I'm happy with it so far we'll see over the next few days..,verified

"My biggest complaint about this case is it has no hole for a person to be able to plug in their head phones. I don't use bluetooth headphones and don't plan to either. There should be a hole..lol. I just don't get why there isn't... makes no sense. Plus, the tray that you place your ipod in doesn't keep it secure especially when you open it up. It can and does slide around easily which can and will cause scratches on the back. Would be better if it had a clip down design.    I just recently bought an Ipod touch 4th generation. It's seems there's not much of a selection of leather flip type cases right now that aren't expensive. I mean I can see how buying something that costs 30 bucks to protect your ipod might be worth it considering how much the ipods are... it would be a good investment (mostly). Although, in my mind at times, I go back to it just being a case to protect my ipod, so it's hard to justify on spending that much money. I want something that keeps my touch safe from being shattered or scraped if it were to drop on the floor. Also I wanted something that didn't make it obvious that I was carrying an ipod touch around... Something that won't cause damage to it while protecting it either. I guess I really couldn't expect much from a 9 dollar item. I already looked else where on amazon and bought a completely different and better designed leather flip case for 20 dollars.",verified
Wonderful bargain... they are work and wear as promised... works as replacement part --great.<br />I would definitely buy them again and again.<br />thank you!,verified
Does the job..Keeps sun glare down.This clip on shade is good for all 5&#34; GPS screens.Metal wire covered in a silicone tube used<br />so it will not melt or warp.As others are cheap plastic that will warp and loose its grip and may fall off.,verified

It's a little complicated to put the ipod inside the band. After that it's confortable use it to workout or to go climbing,verified
I love this mini speaker it is so awesome thank you ever so much I be back to buy my next item thank you again,verified
The Oontz has deservedly good reviews for sound quality so I am just posting a few nitpicks.<br /><br />1) There was a report on Don Lindich's blog that they had redesigned the logo. As of today they are still shipping out the old ugly one.<br /><br />2) The blue light is really annoying to me. Anyone have any good fixes?<br /><br />3) They are using a mini USB charging port in a world dominated by micro USB charged phones. One more thing to carry.<br /><br />4) Makes an audible popping noise about 10 secs after the music stops playing. Probably some sort of disconnection for energy saving.<br /><br />Nothing earth shattering but the difference between a good and excellent product.,not_verified
Works well!,verified
It was really good in fact I got an extra one so I have 2. It's really useful and it's really cheap and works well,verified
My daughter has an iTouch and loves to switch the cover based on her outfit and her mood!  These fit great and are easy to change.,verified
"Works perfectly, paired right up with my Galaxy SIII and works great in my 2008 Denali and my 2008 Accord V6.<br /><br />I didn't use the CD and it came with no printed instructions, but if you are buying this and don't know how to pair something with bluetooth to your phone... then you should consider another product.<br /><br />Read and cleared codes flawlessly<br /><br />I use the Torque app for android",verified
These are great quality speakers and small enough to take with you anywhere.  They are easy to sync (though it doesn't tell you how to turn it on and off since the instructions are a simple sheet using caveman sign language).  You have to figure it out on your own.,verified
"I bought this adapter to allow the phone to charge and use atthe same time.  I was wrong.  Doesnt work at all, never charges.",verified
"Arrived as promise, just what I wanted. Thank you",verified
"First let me say that the supplier send me a complete two page (8 X 11) set of instructions and apologized for the bad instructions sent with the unit. This arrived before the unite! Yes there were some mistakes in his better instructions so I re-wrote them and sent him a copy. That's what I do. . .  write instructions! Well I was still not ready for what I heard out of the unit! The setup is simple and the new instructions clear! Let me say for those reading this that I'm 83 and may not listen to the same music that most buyers will want to listen to, but the tone is there and the highs and mid range is as well. The bass could be a little bit more but will do. Now I have it connected to my computer out and listen to all manor of music from Glenn Miller to The 1812 to jazz. No there are not Hi Fi super stereo! But they are stereo and reproduce a wide spectrum of sound. As I said the unit is connect to the output on the back of my computer. Most computers today that are PC have a Realtek sound Manager program. In control Panel you will find the listing and be able to adjust your playback. Set it to 5.1 and check the 'subwoofer' option. Next use the 'Environment' settings i.e. 'Auditorium' and the Equalizer option setting i.e. 'Rock' ! Next right click on the program and make a 'desktop' shortcut so you can change setting as you change music. Lastly I lost me &#34;c&#34; drive two days after receiving the unit so while waiting I plugged the unit into my Samsung TAB 2 10.1 and the sound and level was almost as good. You may find that the line cable that plugs into your computer is a little short, but extensions can be picked up for not that much. I had sitting around an old mixer from Numark and I used the RCA cables that come with the unit and placed it in the middle which gave me the little more cable length needed and a pair of VU meters! Also a volume control as different cuts are recorder at different levels.<br />Anyone wanting to see and hear the units can contact me on Skype at edward.r.fowler1 and I'll demo them for you! Just put in the contact why or I'll not except!",verified

"Wow, a very innovating experience of listening to music, depending on the surface where you place this extremely portable speaker you achieve different sounds (wood works best for me). I highly recommend this speaker, it works as an mp3 player, portable, 5W speaker, and rechargeable battery lasts about 10 hours.",verified

"In looking for charging cables for my iphone 5s, I found a ton of reviews indicating problems with the new IOS 7 and any cable that wasn't purchased directly form apple, so I was hesitant to purchase a non-apple brand charger at first.  I figured I'd take a shot, and for $11, this one seemed like a relatively safe bet and I didn't really have anything to lose.  I'm glad to say it lived up to my expectations, and exceeded them!  The shipping was FAST, it got here in perfect condition, and it works PERFECTLY.  The 9 ft cable was initially something I didn't care too much about, but has actually turned out to be incredibly useful.<br /><br />Definitely 5 star-worthy and HIGHLY recommended to anyone looking for a more cost-effective alternative to their iphone 5 charger!",verified
"I bought this with the thought of using my Android device(s) with a logitech speaker that was tailored for iDevices.  The \\""works pretty well\\"" title of the review is the summary.  I am able to use this with most of my Android devices, but audio won't play on *the* one I wanted it to work on.  Not a big deal though since I can just use the headphone jack to the speaker's line in and all is well.  The thing I really do like about it is that I can still use it on ALL of my Android devices to charge them since they all use a micro usb to charge.",verified
These things are as good as the Apple branded product at a fraction of the price.,verified
"The case looks nice, but there is no way this case can protect the phone. It is flimsy and thin, and the sides do not come up high enough to protect the screen so a screen protector is a must.  Also the cell and wifi signal strength dropped significantly when the case was on the phone.  I do not recommend this product.",verified

"I don't have a ton of experience with this product yet.  There is a Halloween party in our church parking lot every year.  Everyone decorates their cars with lights and other scary stuff.  Typically, my wife just powers the lights with her car battery and kills her battery over the course of the 3 hour party.  It's never a good idea to completely kill your car battery as it never takes a full charge after a complete drain.  Right after I got this goal0 battery and inverter I gave it to my wife to use to power the Halloween lights on her car for the party.  Worked great and powered all of the lights for the full 3 hours and still had power left.  I have also used it to power my laptop and phone for a few hours and still had over half of the battery life left.  Now I just leave it plugged in and tucked away in case of an emergency where I need power for small electronics and appliances.  The inverter does use an internal fan to cool itself and it is a slight bit noisy.  Nothing you couldn't sleep with if you had to though.",verified

Ok im going to make this short and sweet! I loved this! it worked great it came in really fast and it came exactly as described. I went on amazon and bought myself a phone holder and now I put it in my car and it sounds great! the control could be a little better made but seriously for 6 bucks its a steal plus with the 2 dollars in the holder i made a great buy! I would definetly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a cheap way to listen to music in their car or even at home on any radio.,verified
"These earrings are huge and so gaudy. I purchased them too hastily and didn't pay attention to the size. Also the silver is obviously fake.  I know it's costume jewlery, but I like pieces that make you think they might be real. These are definitely going back.",not_verified
It's not bad.  It gets the job done.  It's not the sturdiest device in the world.  The headphone jack on the one I bought had a lot of static and was virtually unusable.  However it does produce very clear sound when you plug anything into the USB port.  A flash drive works perfectly.    I say if you are looking for a short term answer for a car MP3 player then go for it.  However I woulds not suggest expecting this gadget to be a long-term solution for playing MP3s in your car.,not_verified

"Overpriced, especially when you can pay the same or less for volume and quality.<br /><br />I bought this to teach music in preschool classrooms. The size and weight is nice, but even set to the loudest volume, the speakers are barely audible (playing a CD or iPod makes no difference). I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who plans on playing music through it in a setting where there will be any movement or noise, even if it's minimal.",verified
"I have been waiting for MONTHS and nothing. Eventually I had to contact the seller and they sent me another one but it has been 3 weeks and no sign of it. I strongly advise that, unless you are prepared to wait 1-5 months for your product,you should find another TARDIS IPod case.<br /><br />UPDATE**** I received it today, and I am actually very pleased. It looks exactly like the picture and fits well. I am not sure if other people experienced shipping problems but it might have just been me. Overall I would recommend it because it was worth the wait.",verified
This sub is a direct replacement for a 2013-2014 wrangler factory sub-  holes line up to factory holes and the factory sub grill fits over the new sub. Looks stock when finished. Good idea to use some sound dampening material such as polyfill inside the factory box. Better sound than the cheapy stock.,verified

"Perfect fit, good materials. The corner straps are a little in the way of the on/off button, but not a big problem. The case was what I expected. The screen protector was not easy to apply. I did not use the decorative stickers and never intended to. The price for the items was so reasonable, the stickers did not matter. I figured they would just eventually peel off at the corners and look crappy.",verified
"Initial review written shortly after purchase:  \\""Flexible Goose-neck\\"" is an exaggeration.  Feels more like a stiff, but somewhat bendable rod covered in a plastic sleeve made to LOOK like a goose-neck.  VERY difficult to shape the way you want it.  Removing the ball from the OEM socket was no problem and inserting the new ball joint into the TomTom Via was only slightly difficult.  You WANT it to be stiff and to fit snugly!  However, sliding the GPS device onto the new mount was EXTREMELY difficult.  In fact, I am not sure I got it all the way in.<br /><br />This goose-neck holder does provide you with several more inches of room and a lever suction device - both are vast improvements over the OEM, IF the suction device holds.  I have not yet tried it while driving.<br /><br />Follow-up to review after 15 months of experience.  Bottom line, I am about to buy another one for my wife's new TomTom Via 1535, also bought through Amazon.  Yes, the goose-neck is not really a flexible goose-neck. AND, it IS very stiff.  BUT, I have discovered that this is EXACTLY what you want in order to keep the GPS device where you place it.  However, I did find that IF suspended mid-air, the TomTom would vibrate.  This was very annoying, especially since I initially kept the TomTom just above the dashboard which it would rattle against.  I reconfigured the gooseneck and relocated the suction cup such that when in place, the GPS device RESTS firmly on the dashboard.  MUCH BETTER.<br /><br />I have gotten to appreciate the mounting system for the TomTom to the gooseneck.  It is VERY stiff at first, but eased up a bit with the frequent removals necessitated by map updates.  You WANT it to be stiff so that it holds firmly to the device.  It is easily removed by placing your fingers a certain way and applying pressure (I can't explain it in words).<br /><br />After my year of experience, I changed my rating to FIVE stars for this gizmo.  The suction cup holds firmly.  With the GPS device resting against the dashboard, all is very well, at a good angle for me and yet - by twisting the TomTom up - allows easy access for removal for updating the GPS device.",verified
I do not like the common ear plugs that insert inside the ear opening.  I've tried other over-the-ear clips and they broke almost immediately or just didn't sit right.  This is my second pair of Koss and they are extremely comfortable and I will buy again when these break.  I listen to Audio Books almost exclusively so I cannot really review the clips for quality sound that one might want when listening to music and tones.,verified
"This is small and lightweight. It was simple to load songs onto, thankfully because there were no instructions. The only problem is that when you are not using it, you have to remove the AAA battery or it will be dead the next time you turn it on. But if you take out the battery, it works fine. For the money, it works great for me!",verified

"Well, this one is a solid good piece of technology. Awesome compatibility and features for PC (not designed for Mac / Apple computers). Although it does work even with Apples for mp3 files and photo albums. FM radio playback, FM radio recorder and Voice Recorder are working perfect regardless of your platform.    If you are using PC like myself you will find KEO very impressive. It does deliver all as promised. Great mp3 playback with various equalizer options to optimize the audio output of the music you are listening to. I find \\""Rock\\"" setting to be the most powerful for my collection.  Various replay modes are also useful: as sometimes you want just one file over and over again, or just one folder.    Now again - it is not a MAC system. It in fact reminds more of the PC architecture and logics. No sorting by Artist or playlists here, but you can resolve it same way you did on the PC - by putting music files in certain folders.    If you put 120 files in the same directory - yes, scrolling may be lengthy, as it is not a quick-scroll touchscreen. But within 30+ files in each folder - you are fine. This is a convenient gym / sports / jogging system, not an 80-gig portable file depot.    FM radio works better if you leave the earbuds in the player. Their cord works just fine as an extended antennae. Regarding the earbud quality - mine sound just the same as a set from Shure. Seriously - when you close your eyes - you can't tell a difference.    And all these advanced features are bundled in a cool sturdy high-tech casing. Plus it comes with necklace and an armband - very thoughtful of iceTECH guys and saves you time for looking \\""how to attach it\\"".

"I sit at my computer 6-12 hours a day.  As a woman only slightly over 5' tall, every chair in the world is too high for me.  My feet rarely touch the floor.  Any doctor or chiropractor will tell you; when your feet can't comfortably reach the floor with your thighs parallel to the floor, your back will take the strain of trying to compensate.  I bought a portable footrest for when I'm out of the house, but needed something larger and more comfortable for the hours I sit at my desk.  This is it! The foot pad is large enough that my feet still rest on it even if I change positions.  It is adjustable in height (up/down) and rotates at an angle (slant) so I can get it just right. The only negative is the written directions that come with it.  They are not very clear, nor complete about how to adjust it.  I figured out the slant, but couldn't find the height adjustment, even though the instructions said it was adjustable.  I finally turned it over and inspected it very carefully to find the adjustment area. I then had to re-read the directions and experiment to figure out how to use it.  (And I am fairly mechanical minded! I know many people who would not have been able to figure it out at all.) I gave it 5 stars, because the product itself is great.  But I would encourage the manufacturer to re-write the instruction page.  It is well worth the price; it costs less than the cost of a trip to the chiropractor!",verified

"This unit is a combination external battery charger and speaker, and it has nice potential. I was initially VERY frustrated by the poor instructions included in the retail box... specifically, there is no information in the guide on how to charge the internal 4000mAh battery. The instructions need a total redo, and once we figured out how to use this device we liked it.<br /><br />Battery function<br /><br />After unpacking the device, find the supplied multi-cable kept in the area under the tray inside of the box. This cable has a standard male USB on one end that splits into two pigtail ends; one pigtail is a male micro-USB and the other a male 3.5mm AUX.<br /><br />Plug the standard USB end into your favorite charging device (wall charger, USB charging station, laptop USB port, etc...), we used our Samsung wall charger, and then pull the end-cap off of the battery/speaker unit to (1) turn the unit on and (2) access the unit's ports.<br /><br />Once the end-cap is pulled off, plug the cable's 3.5mm Aux pigtail end into the corresponding port on the battery. There seem to be two 3.5mm Aux ports on the end of the battery, but one is just a dummy and the other is real. The active one is not marked, but you will be able to tell when you pick the proper one as the device's LED light will light up and a voice may say 'Bluetooth' or 'Aux connect'... the voice seems to randomly say things from time-to-time. If you stick the 3.5mm Aux jack into the dummy hole, nothing happens at all.<br /><br />The unit has three small LED lights that inform you of the remaining charge in the battery; upon initial connection, one light was lit signifying that the unit may have been up to 33% precharged by the factory. Over the next six or seven hours, the battery progressed to full charge... which seems like a fairly long time give out 2.1A charger's output. Further reading indicated why; the input flow rate of this unit is just 0.8A max, regardless of the power source's capability. That's fairly slow and even at that rate we did feel a little heat built up near the connection end as charging was going on.<br /><br />Once charged, using the battery was not difficult; using either the supplied cable or the cable that come with your device (recommended), just connect your device to the battery's USB port and charge your device as needed. The storage capacity of this battery is 4000mAh which is good for a charge and another partial boost, but not for multiple charges without recharging.<br /><br />The charging times we experienced were about what we get from 1A wall chargers... on average, a rate of about 1/3 percent per minute, which equates to about 1% every 2.5 to three minutes or about 20% - 25% per hour. The batteries in our phones are 2200 mAh and 2400mAh in capacity, so this makes sense given the battery's 1A rated output.<br /><br />Speaker function<br /><br />For its size, the speaker actually punches out decent sounds; it is fairly convenient and portable at 4 7/8 inches long, 1.25 inches (roughly) in diameter and about 4.8 ounces per our postal scale. The backup battery & speaker combo unit is an easy carry in your purse, jacket pocket or back-pack.<br /><br />The specifications in the paltry user guide notes that the speaker was \\""ZW\\"" of power... assume they meant 2W, and it puts out good volume for the small size.<br /><br />You can crank it up fairly loud without significant distortion, and when laid flat on a solid foundation like a counter or table  top, it provides decent bass, and good mid and treble. There are no controls (volume, next track, skip, etc...) available on the unit itself, so all of the control must come from your sending device. Not a problem for us, and the speaker actually responded well to the equalizer application on my phone.<br /><br />You can send music to this device by Bluetooth or by direct wire view the 3.5mm port (same port you used to charge the battery...)<br /><br />Bluetooth<br /><br />Pulling the battery/speaker's end-cap off and then putting it back into place is what is needed in order to activate the speaker's Bluetooth search (blue LED light flashes). Pairing with my phone was quick and trouble-free, and we found the range to be good -- better than many other similar devices we have tested.<br /><br />Typically the phone paired with the speaker was within three to 12 feet of the speaker, with relatively good line of sight between the two devices. The BT sound production is not bad at all and, as mentioned, it responded nicely to my equalizer app.<br /><br />3.5mm Aux<br /><br />This unit's speaker also plays nicely through 3.5mm Aux connection, and it offers an interesting feature; the end-cap has two male 3.5mm Aux connectors built into it, and they can be used in this process. All you do is plug one in to the 3.5mm headphone port of your sending device (like my HTC Droid DNA) and the other into the active 3.5mm Aux port on the unit.<br /><br />The sound produced by the 3.5mm Aux cable connection is really not bad at all, and by situating the connection from the back-side of your sending device, the battery becomes a lengthwise stand.  This works very well, especially when we decided to watch a Netflix movie on my phone.<br /><br />The opportunity here is that not all transmission devices are configured in a way that the end-cap can be used to make the 3.5mm Aux connection... we have an older MP3 player that is just too thick. It would have been nice if the manufacturer had included a 3.5mm Aux cable with male jacks on both ends, but then we do have several of those already and they worked fine with this speaker too. The Amazon listing's \\""Package Contents\\"" section does not that the unit includes \\""1xThe 3.5 mm audio line\\"", but we did not receive a separate 3.5mm cable... just the portion attached to the single multi-cable included with the unit.<br /><br />Sorry about the length of this review... just turned out that way. Many ins & outs, pluses and minuses...<br /><br />No mention of a warranty that we could find, so if an issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this device gratis from the seller and have put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a combination 4000mAh power bank, 2W speaker & stand of this size, style, price and capacity, for use as I have described above, then we would recommend giving this unit a try based on our experience with it. Just have a little patience, and all will be fine<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.speaker's end-cap off and then putting it back into place is what is needed in order to activate the speaker's Bluetooth search (blue LED light flashes).

All you do is plug one in to the 3.5mm headphone port of your sending device (like my HTC Droid DNA) and the other into the active 3.5mm Aux port on the unit.<br /><br />The sound produced by the 3.5mm Aux cable connection is really not bad at all, and by situating the connection from the back-side of your sending device, the battery becomes a lengthwise stand.  This works very well, especially when we decided to watch a Netflix movie on my phone.<br /><br />The opportunity here is that not all transmission devices are configured in a way that the end-cap can be used to make the 3.5mm Aux connection... we have an older MP3 player that is just too thick. It would have been nice if the manufacturer had included a 3.5mm Aux cable with male jacks on both ends, but then we do have several of those already and they worked fine with this speaker too. The Amazon listing's \\""Package Contents\\"" section does not that the unit includes \\""1xThe 3.5 mm audio line\\"", but we did not receive a separate 3.5mm cable... just the portion attached to the single multi-cable included with the unit.<br /><br />Sorry about the length of this review... just turned out that way. Many ins & outs, pluses and minuses...<br /><br />No mention of a warranty that we could find, so if an issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this device gratis from the seller and have put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.<br /><br />If you are looking for a combination 4000mAh power bank, 2W speaker & stand of this size, style, price and capacity, for use as I have described above, then we would recommend giving this unit a try based on our experience with it. Just have a little patience, and all will be fine<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.",not_verified
"I usually don't write reviews, but my experience with this particular product gave me reason to give warning... This product will fry your tablet... Luckily my tablet did recover (I hate that it didn't for a previous reviewer) but the sd card reader and usb slot on my dock are dead. Also the usb cable is too short to be usable. I'm sticking with OEM and will make due without a car charger until  Asus makes one.<br /><br />Please note that I have the TF201 model but the only for TF101 warning wasn't there when I made the purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />Upate April 10: I've tried two different keyboard docks and there is no sd card reader or usb port activity with either one, so this charger did short out something in my tablet.

"It has been some time that I have been wanting to get back into quality car audio. I finally did and boy am I glad I chose to go almost exclusively Alpine. I have an 02 Ram 1500 quad cap with the Thunderform box with [[ASIN:B00BJF4W0O MTX Audio 5510-22 5500 Series Subwoofer]]. These were an upgrade to what came with the box. In the front I have the [[ASIN:B004VBIEZW Alpine SPR-60C 6.5\\"" Car Audio Component System (Pair)]] and the [[ASIN:B004VSTYI6 Alpine SPR-60 6.5\\"" Car Audio Coaxial Speakers (Pair)]] in the rear. I was thinking that the setup would be \\""pretty good\\"" and possibly needing more speakers. Well let me tell you, this system powered by this amp will rip your face off if set up properly. The first comment I get every time after they stop grinning is how super crisp and clear the audio is even at the top volumes. I used to be an installer and I can't say enough good things about Alpine hardware. I did try a Kenwood head unit at first and then replaced it with the [[ASIN:B00CKYH9Q2 Alpine CDE-HD149BT CD Receiver with Bluetooth and HD Radio Built-in]]. Even that was leaps and bounds better. This amp has a birth certificate that states it puts out close to 1100 watts continuous total power. To be able to power my whole system with a unit this small still boggles my mind. I have had zero issues with this amp and I play the crap out of it for hours and hours on end. I don't throw 5 star reviews out easy but this unit deserves every one.",verified
"I thought I was ordering the Presentation Cable with Extended length and built in usb cable, etc, etc....like they say in the product description.  However, instead of a long cable with multiple connections for my PDA baby, I got a stubby little converter that allows you to connect to a monitor, projector or other VGA line.  While this connection is a large part of what I wanted, it is hardly everything I expected for the grand sum of 50 dollars (44 + s&h).  I expected to have both a VGA connection and a secondary charging cable for my money, so that I could charge/sync my PDA (especially given the crummy battery life of the Dell Axim x51v) at work as well as at home without having to cart around a charging cable or cradle (really, one and the same thing since to charge with cradle the cable must be connected to it).  I am very disappointed...how much would it cost to include, at the very least, a usb cable with this connector?  I'll definitely be looking to get my money refunded by either Amazon or the seller I got this from, Electronica Direct.",verified

"I found the NT70T to be a great companion to my iPhone, my iPad Mini and my AT&T Elevate 4G. The tri port functionality was great and found myself using it frequently to charge my elevate 4G. The built in USB for charging the New Trent is extremely convenient, much better than having to hunt for a cable. Nice of them to throw in a USB extension cord too.<br /><br />The NT70T is one neat package. Size and weight are great and very complimentary to typical device size now a days (iPhone, Galaxy III etc). I could comfortably put it in my pocket along with my phone while running from one flight to the next. The micro USB connection worked great for charging my elevate and saved me having to hunt for that one cable in my bag...if only the iPhone was so simple...but thats not New Trent's fault.<br /><br />Comparing to the NT52D that I also own, they both perform flawlessly however the NT70T is a little more classy looking and a lot more convenient with the built in USB for charging and the micro USB for charging devices.<br /><br />Highly recommended this device and New Trent makes one of the best external batteries out there.",not_verified

"I initially was deciding between the Jawbone Jambox and the Jabra Solemate for a bluetooth speaker. Then I saw the Beatblock.  I was immediately impressed with its design. It just looked like a very solid well-built speaker. After doing some research on the BeatBlock (the only reviews I found were on youtube), the Solemate and the Jambox, I decide to buy the Beatblock.  The first thing that I noticed was the weight and feel of the speaker - not light and cheap like some others I have seen, but solid, not too heavy and an almost ballistic feel to it.  After charging it according to the instructions, I very easily synced the speaker with my IPhone 5 and started playing some music.  The sound filled my living room without maxing out on the volume, and had no distortion.  I tested the volume at maximum level and got a little distortion on songs with heavy bass, but was able to fix that by adjusting the volume on my phone.  I played a variety of music from classical to rock and pretty much everything inbetween, and can say without hesistation that this speaker is awesome!! Battery life is phenomenal at about 10 hours on a full charge!  Shipping was also very quick - just under a week - considering I live on Guam!",verified

Plus it's pink. The way it sets up is OK. It could have more ways to have different angles.  The way it sets up to be a gentle angle comes out and flops out easily.  So there are only two angles, straight up and a slight angle.  Which the slight angle is virtually useless.  Even with all that said, I still like it better than the cover I got from Verizon.

"I have been using the IMP1000 Power pack for about 2 months now. This product is fantastic.  I made the purchase because I needed a power pack for a 2 week trip to Alaska.  We used this power pack for 2 weeks in National Parks, hiking trips and car travels.  It worked flawlessly.  I used the product about 12 hours the first day to power a GoPro Hero camera as we filmed HD video of our travels thru Denali National Park.  When we got back to our cabin....I thought I would recharge the power pack.  I was pleasantly surprised to see it still had about 80% of a charge left.  I decided that I would see how long I could go on a single charge.  After about 5 days of filming, Ipod Touch 1st gen, and an android cell phone recharging....the power pack needed to be recharged.  This is a terrific battery and perfect for my Alaska vacation.  We continued to use the power pack thru-out the remainer of our vacation and had absolutely no problems.            Returning from Alaska, I decided to see how the battery pack would handle the daily grid on a construction site.  I used my Android phone 8 hours a day streaming music and the power pack kept the phone going strong all day.  I was able to go 3 1/2 days before I needed to recharge the power pack.  I never have run the battery completely down.  The indicator light was flashing 1 light so I figured time to recharge.  It has been about 2 months since my purchase.  I am very impressed by this power pack.  Several people have inquired about it and indicated they plan to purchase one.  I also took it over to the US Cellular store and they were very interested in it.  They commented they have had alot of customers asking about a battery like this.....but didnt know it existed.",verified
"I bought this radio mostly for its SD card reading ability and because the reviews were generally positive. SD cards can load VERY slowly if you have a lot of tracks on them. The control layout is acceptable, but not great. Sound seems fine, but I'm no audiophile. Fairly often (maybe 1 in 4) it forgets which track you left off on after powering down, which can be an annoyance. Additionally, this radio does not recall where in a track you stopped. This makes it difficult to use with podcasts, especially when combined with its slow fast forward (only 2x speed). This means that if you stop most of the way through an hour podcast, it goes right back to the beginning. Consequently I use my ipod via the aux in input to listen to podcasts. Sometimes the jack needs to be jiggled when the audio goes out. I've tested and it's not the cable. Rarely with more than about 80 tracks on an SD card, the radio will start playing static. If you've turned it up to listen to a quiet podcast, this can be extremely loud! Power cycling the radio and then skipping tracks until you reach the one it left off on fixes this, but it's still annoying.    Basically, think about what you need in a radio. If you like longer podcasts, go with something else (although user's manuals and reviews often neglect to mention anything about track position saving, so good luck). If you just want to listen to music or short podcasts, and don't mind some minor glitches, then this system could do the job for you. Now that we have very tiny USB thumb drives, the SD card reading feature is a lot less important.    Anybody know an USB mp3 radio that remembers position in the last track?",verified

"I bought nine of these and loaded each one with a custom playlist for each family member or friend. Each one worked perfectly; not a single one was &#34;defective.&#34;<br /><br />Some down sides:<br /><br />1. Some came in little plastic boxes and some came with cords and some came with earbuds. Some didn't come with anything. Be prepared to have to get one or all of these things. Be aware that a mini usb cable is less than a dollar here on Amazon. You might have to purchase one to charge the device.<br /><br />2. THEY DO NOT COME WITH STORAGE. I think most of the reviews that claim that this device didn't work is failing to understand what that means. In plain English, it won't hold your songs unless you buy an extra piece. The description says this. You were informed when you purchased it. There's a five dollar piece that is required before you can use this. You might already have this piece because it's commonly used in cameras, mobile phones, and other electronics. You can buy one on Amazon for less than 5 dollars.<br /><br />Note: The storage is supposed to be up to 8GB. I saw a review of a guy who got a much larger Micro SD card to work, but when I used a larger card the songs started to skip (like a scratched CD) and didn't sound right. You really don't need more than 8.<br /><br />The awesome things:<br /><br />1. It's lightweight<br />2. It plays songs with really decent quality if you use good mp3 files<br />3. the charge lasts for a long time (there's no screen to power and it takes very little energy). Use the switch on the side to turn it off when you're not using it. There's a red light to indicate when it's on.<br />4. You can arrange the songs in the order you want them to play. When I made my gifts, I wanted an intro track to play first. The way you make sure your songs play in order is to drag your files onto the card in the order you want them to play. That's it.<br /><br />To use:<br />1. Make sure it's completely charged. Use the mini USB cordto plug it in. It will light up to indicate it's charging. There's no way to know when it's full. Just charge overnight.<br />2. Use a Micro SD card adapter to connect the card to the computer. Most Micro SDs come with an adapter. There are several on Amazon under 5 dollars that include the adapter.<br />3. Open the file folder and drag mp3 files into the folder. Drag them in the order you want them to play (don't rearrange them once they're in there, just add them in batches or one by one in the order).<br />4. Safely remove your Micro SD card adapter.<br />5. Slide the Micro SD card into your player (it will have the underside facing you if you're looking straight at the front where the play button is). Press it until you hear a click.<br />6. Switch the unit &#34;on&#34; and it will automatically start playing. Have earbuds or headphones plugged in while you do this.",not_verified

"The Hybrid Kickstand works fine and the black outer cover works great for screen protection.  Also, if you're interested in clipping the device to your clothing or bag, the clip function on the black outer cover works.  Here's what I would change:  the rubberized casing kickstand only allows for horizontal placement of the device.  The device cannot stand vertically while in the casing.  The black outer casing also has a kickstand -- that kickstand is a nice one that would allow both horizontal and vertical placement.  Unfortunately, the device only fits into the black outer casing with the screen covered.  The device, with or without the casing, does not fit screen side out in the black outer cover.  Because I don't carry my device around too often, the black outer cover is pretty useless.",verified

"I purchased 3 of these units thinking they would work like simular units I have purchased for church in the past.  The problem is we record the service and place them on flash drives in mp3 format and with the other players we have if you insert the drive they will play the service or music.  This unit I can not get to play from USB, so i don't understand what the slot is even there for if it will not play music from it.  I tried all 3 devices just incase I had a bad one or two units.  As this is my only use for the units, I can not comment on other features except I did like that the battery is removal recharge unit, all the other simular unit the I have tried the battery is built in so when it dies the unit is trash.

"I purchased a Samsung 55-Inch 1080p 3D Slim LED HDTV in March of 2013. Unfortunately, I had trouble with this product, which meant I needed to make repairs through SquareTrade. Because I had a crazy schedule, and was making preparations for moving to another home, making an appointment with the SquareTrade technicians was hectic. They diagnosed the issues I had with the TV, and promptly sent parts out for the repair so that the parts were on-hand when the technician arrived. They were very patient and willing to work around my schedule. When the technician finally made the intended repairs, it became apparent overnight that the problem was not fixed. The technician turned in his report, and after he did, I called SquareTrade back to discuss the issues with my TV. Without hesitation, the man on the other end made the decision to reimburse my purchase price so that I could buy a replacement TV. There was no haggling over the amount or over my claim at all. The reimbursement has actually taken less time than the attempted repairs. I have nothing but praise for the way my claim was handled. I will continue to use SquareTrade wherever I need the service.",not_verified

"This fm transmitter is better than others for a few reasons.     1. It comes with a remote (and it actually works)    2. It is very small and does not require an external power source so you can have your iWhatever-You-Have anywhere you want. You can move it around because there are no wires.    3. It has a power source so you can plug it in if you want to.    There are a few minor problems with this product, but it does not affect its functionality.    1. The power chord will power everything, but it will not charge my iPhone 3GS specifically. (It supposedly charges ipods and such though)    2. It is very small (yeah when this is the worst thing I can think of about this product you know its good). Its great how small it is; Be careful not to lose it.    At a few dollars in price I have no problem recommending this product. I have been using it for a while now with no problems.",verified
"I bought this for my car after watching to many Russian YouTube videos. I had problems with it at first but I figured out that this camera cannot handle a 32gb sd card like it says even a top of the line one. I purchased a 16gb class 10 top of the line sd card and haven't had any problems now. It's pretty awesome, it shows date time and so on, really good video recorded. Turns on and records automatically when I start the car. So for the price it's worth it just make sure not to get to large of a sd card, if it wasn't for that it would get 5 stars. And I wish that the windshield mount swiveled. But it's a really good suction cup. :)",verified
"Pros: The design is great. It is very stylish and modern. The top is a shiny kind of plastic while the bottom is a smooth matte finish that won't disappoint. The feel is not to rubbery while not to slippery which is perfect for holding. It feels like it has a high quality build to it and could probably survive a few drops. The lights are the perfect size and not too big like some other models; they turn off after half a minute so that if you are using at night they won't be to obtrusive. The charge time on this thing is awesome, maybe around. 3.5 times on my iPhone 4s.<br /><br />Cons: The lights turning off when the device is charging may be a con for some people but I found it useful. Small lights may make some people wish they were bigger. Also when you press the button once you aren't sure whether the battery will stay on by itself and waste battery. Maybe try an extended button hold time to turn the device fully on while just pressing it once to check the battery. The shiny surface can pickup fingerprints easily and if you have sweaty hands then it might get dirty quickly. Also the shiny sides bugged me the most because they weren't metal but some plastic with a shiny covering making it feel cheap. The charger and cord also feel poorly built and could be made of high quality materials. The LED indicators weren't fully accurate because the battery pack would keep most of its charge on the third LED and then dwindle very quickly on the last two.<br /><br />Suggestions: Make more button modes like off functions, or 4 second press to turn one, one press to check battery etc. Include a case and a wall and car charger. Make the sides out of real metal or something that feels higher quality. Even out the LED indicators so that they accurately tell the battery life left. Maybe try a little more matter look instead of the shiny surface.",not_verified

"I was a little hesitant to purchase and FM transmitter for my car. I heard they didn't work as advertised and that I would hear a lot of static with my music. But when I bought a used car and an FM transmitter was the only way I'd be able to listen to my iPod, I needed to get one.    The Griffin Roadtrip Hands-Free was the only practical option when it came to FM transmitters. It plays and charges the iPod just like it's supposed to and the ability to talk on the phone through the car stereo and microphone is really nice. The only design flaw I can think of right now is that instead of pausing the iPod when a phone call comes in, it mutes the music. I have songs on my iPod because I like the music and I don't want to miss them if I have a long conversation on the phone. You can still manually pause the iPod, but it creates an extra step.    In terms of performance, I've heard that sound quality can depend quite heavily on the location of a car's antenna. Mine is built in to the rear window and I'd say sound quality is pretty good. If I listen hard, or during pauses between songs, I can usually hear a little static. The biggest factor in sound quality is the competing radio stations. I've found a station that maintains good quality for my trip from work to home, but if I deviate from that path, I usually have to use the Roadtrip's built in station finder. It usually does a good job of picking clear stations, but sometimes it only lasts for a few minutes.    In terms of the physical layout, the buttons are easy to find and press, and the lighting of the screen is not too bright for night driving. I love being able to rotate the iPod dock and move the neck around. It holds the position well, though I've only had it for about two months.    If you're looking for a good FM transmitter, I'd highly recommend you purchase this one. It's not perfect, but in my eyes, it's the best one one the market.",verified

"I got this because it seemed to be a cover that would save me a lot of energy of holding the kindle while reading.  The idea of it is very good (different positioning), but it isn't a good fit.  Mine case is actually slightly smaller for my third generation kindle so it's stretching the edges a little (the picture showed a nice fitting).  It said that it was made with genuine leather, but it is not!  At least it does not smell nor feel like it to me.  The stitching wasn't the greatest either.  it is also way too heavy and bulky.  The flap that holds the two sides together needed to be pulled or stretched a little in order to have it closed, and even with that, the magnetic closure was very weak.  This is not what I was expecting.  Weighing in all the negatives, this cover/case is way too expensive for the price (plus shipping).  This cover/case should be no more than a few dollars.  Had I paid only a few dollars for it then I would have given it a five star because then I know what I'd be expecting.  I would recommend another similar cover/case with another maker even if you had to pay more.  Thanks for the car charger though (I gave it a three star because of the free car charger otherwise the rating would be lower)!  But, I'd rather pay the price for a better product instead of a free car charger.    I'm editing my review and giving it four stars instead on this item because it is growing on me.  Whatever I said before still holds true, but after stretching it out a bit, it is a better fit now, but still slightly stretched on the left and right sides of the screen like when you wear a buttoned shirt a size too small.  Like I said, after stretching it out, the clasp or the flap that holds the two sides together with the magnetic closure is a better fit now and it stays put. It is still a little heavy as a case, but it doesn't feel as rigid as before rather a solid feel as a case.  Yes, the back stand does wiggle a little (this should be better made so that it doesn't wiggle), but not much trouble to it.  I have to say, I kind'a like it now.  So, here is my four stars.  It should still be cheaper though.  Oh, by the way, the \\""leather\\"" (whether it is real or not) smells horrible!  I hope that I can wipe the smell off somehow.  Perhaps it will go away in time, or I'll just get use to it.",verified

This cover has it all, with an elastic band that holds the cover closed in my purse or holds the cover folded back if I need it. It also gives excellent access to the buttons if you choose to use those instead of touch control.<br /><br />Two minor issues--The appearance of the stitching could be better; it detracts somewhat from the looks of the product.  And, probably because this is a less expensive cover, the velvety inside liner appears somewhat cheap.  Overall, though, I am very satisfied.

I bought this arm band for my girlfriend for Christmas.  She likes that it is pink.  She also told me that it is very handy.  The only issue is what to do with the extra cord from her headphones.  What she does is wrap the cord around the arm band a couple of times and the reduces the slack and then it is not in her way while working out.,not_verified

"I bought this watch because of the claim of being the thinnest watch ever made.  But this watch is substantially thicker at the center than at the diameter; nearly 6.5 millimeters as measured with precision calipers.  I'm not sure what \\""Diameter less than 2 millimeters thick\\"" means in its ads.  That disappointment aside, the watch is very attractive and presents nicely on your wrist.  It does lack a seconds hand which you may miss if you're trying to take your pulse.",not_verified
It breaks really easily. Ugh.,verified
It is a little hard to apply the screen cover but it definately works well with the pen and does not stop the S-pen too much,verified
"I choose this rating because the back up camera freezes.  GPS and bluetooth both work, however I was not able to update gps with given instructions and you need to talk loud for bluetooth.  I had the installation done at Best Buy.  I have not used this unit very much but it seems to work.",verified
I love it because when I need a spare charger and cord while traveling I can use the spare charger and cord and  it really works. Also you cannot beat the price !!!<br /><br />Thanks<br />bigwill360,verified
"It's ok!  Does the job, a little too hot pink for me.  Fit is nice, protection good, just not too high on the color, or the rain drops.  Didn't notice them on the photo before I ordered.",verified
"Well it's a pretty simple product that does what it promises to do.  I was compelled to write a review because I was impressed by the overall build quality and aesthetics of this simple car charger.  The plug fits snugly into the cigarette lighter socket, unlike some other similar products I have used.  Also, not described anywhere in the product features, is the fact that the \\""HTC\\"" logo illuminates with a nice white LED backlight when power is flowing to the charger.  This lets you know it is delivering power to your device, but also just looks nice.  HTC seems to include little features like this across their product line.  One final note, make sure you are buying the genuine HTC item, not some knock off.  There are several around that appear to be the same item as this but for a few dollars less.  They are total junk.  This charger is great.",verified
Worst product ever...,verified

This case is a joke. It is just way too big for Gen 3 iPod-touch. Went straight into the garbage!,verified
"I have to say that I'm disappointed about what I got. I wanted something that fit snug around my player. It is made loosely and the silicone rubber skin is very thin. If your looking for something that will protect your player in a case of a drop, I would keep looking. If they made it thicker and more tightly around the player I would be happy.",not_verified
"Great case!  Size is perfect, the straps hold the Garmin in place, and the inside is soft and protects the screen. Gave my husband one last year and got this one to give to my daughter this year.  The Skque is the best quality I have seen.  The price is great, also!!",verified

"I needed this for a Soundstream Rubicon 2500d amp for one of my rides and it was between this(OEM one).. or a generic, universal RCA bass knob with RCA inputs and outputs.

this fits the Zen stone exactly and cushions it from bumps.  It has a smoother fit than the picture shows.  You can attach a key ring to the holder so you can carry your Zen easily.  Also comes with an elastic arm band which slips through a slot in in the back of the holder.  Worth it.,verified
"I almost returned this and rated it zero stars after it initially showed that the Iphone 4s wouldn't charge.  I tried it again and this time pressed a little harder and bam, it made better connection and works great.    I'm using this with a ISimple Gateway (Ipod connectivity for my Honda Pilot) and a Verizon Iphone 4s.  With the case I had, the ISimple's Ipod connector wouldn't make contact.  With the adapter, it plays music and charages.  ISimple Gateway  http://www.amazon.com/PAC-ISHD571-Complete-Honda-Vehicles/dp/B00455IS1O/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1326127245&sr=8-4",verified

It Is Great!!!!  My Upper Arm Is Really Thick.  Most Of These Armbands Only Fit 1/2-way up my lower arm...This One Fits Where It's Supposed To!  It's Sturdy And Will Be Perfect!!!

I Can't Charge It In The Sleeve And The Dial Is Exposed...But Since I Can Wear It High On My Arm...I Don't Have To Worry About Getting It Wet While Getting Dishes Done (I Work In A Kitchen).  Love It!!!  It Looks Like It'll Last!!!!,verified
"Great price! Great looking case! It took about 1 1/2 weeks to receive the case. I am new to the tablet world but broke down and bought a Nook HD+ for travel. I didn't like pecking the screen so I bought this keyboard case. I am also no techno person but it was easy to link the keyboard to my Nook.  I discovered that the keyboard is magnetic! So if I just want to read, I can leave the keyboard behind and still have a nice looking case. The keyboard keys are a good size and the touch is easy. I replied to an e-mail using the keyboard like a typist (2 hands) without any problem. I would recommend this product to everyone.",verified
"I still give it 5 stars because I knew the following would happen.  The chain broke on the first day of handling it.  The chain holds the key cap on.  However, I had read this in prior reviews and expected it.  A person could always put a stronger chain on it but I knew this was the case and we actually don't want to bother with the end cap.<br /><br />The cover is perfect.  It's a soft rubber and fits nicely.  The white emblems show nicely and clean up a worn Mercedes key.  I need two but I ordered one to see how I like it.  I will be ordering 2 more now just to have extra.  Very pleased.<br /><br />Another advantage is the opening for a key chain.  Our key is missing the key insert and we had no place to attach a key chain but now we can.",verified

Took an extra 2 days over expected delivery date.<br />The less to light out the &#34;rich&#34; and &#34;lean&#34; were not working right out of the box. The &#34;optimal&#34; light lasted 3 days. Flickered on and off for a day. And dosnt work.<br />If you don't have this wired straight to the battery the low volt light comes on for a really long time<br />No adjustment of the brightness<br />Not accurate. Wired in a wide band a/f gauge and this one was off by almost a full point at all time randomly high and low.<br />If u want a cheep way to see your a/f then go for it,verified
Delivery time was great length on item is good fits an adult down to the middle of the chest kids longer but fits its purpose,verified

"The title says it all.  It's well made and does a great job keeping a large vehicle antenna upright, yet preventing it from being damaged if it contacts something.",verified
"I had to send this product back to get repaired after the GPS went out in one and on the other, the bluetooth wouldn't work. I installed these in my wife's Tiguan and in my Passat. Trying to use the steering wheel controls with this unit is a nightmare as well. You can only use one button for one function which means your talk button either answers your calls or ends the call, not both. The calibration of the touchscreen is off as well (even after re-calibrating).<br /><br />if theres any sunlight on the screen, you will not be able to see anything on the screen. Overall, I would not recommend this product.",verified
I have used RAM mounts in the past. They have never disappointed.  Got this to mount a new Humminbird 788ci HD DI on. Worked perfectly.,verified

"I recently purchased my Creative Zen Vision M 60GB because my 30GB was stolen during a car break-in.  I had purchased a Boxwave FlexiSkin for that one and was extremely satisfied with the product.  It not only fit snugly on the player (it actually STICKS to the player as well as to whatever you laid the player on), but it looked quite professional. I also couldn't figure out how dust didn't stick to it, but the skin would stick to any surface it was laid on.      Well, since Boxwave doesn't make the FlexiSkin for the 60GB Vision M (too fat). I decided to try purchasing this skin on Amazon.  I couldn't be more disappointed.  The inside of the skin doesn't stick to the player, so the player is able to slip around.  I can't imagine anyone using the armband for something as heavy as the 60GB, but should it be tried, I'm afraid the results would be disappointing as well.  The skin is so flexible and the player so heavy that the player would be slung around like a rock on a rubber band.  The outside of the skin is so sticky that dust seems to be attracted to it.    On the upside, the outside of the skin is sticky enough that when you lay the player on any surface, it will stay put.    I won't buy this product again and I'll steer clear of the manufacturer as well.",not_verified
"What I like about the product is:  1) the price  2) it has a stiff top and bottom shell and therefore feels like it would be more protective of the enclosed device  3) like that they have a variety of colors - makes it easier to spot a specific portable hard drive     I was hoping that all my portable Hard Drives would fit into it, but 2 out of 3 ain't bad - the Maxtor Basics was just a mite too wide. It maybe a good idea to inform customers on the internal dimensions of the case - to see if their device has a better chance of fitting into it.",verified

"If you don't have a computer, this set up for your Ipod is great. you can charge your Ipod in your hotel or in your car. The speakers that came with this set up is a little larger then expected. Although the speakers are not Bose, they don't sound too bad. Great for sharing your music with others in the room with you. Speaker do need an alternate plug to operate (regular household plug). Great price for everything as well",verified
"Please let me save you the trouble if you want this for your ipod touch. It is WAY to big for an ipod touch. It does not fit at all. I called the company to complain and they said they would stop advertising it as an ipod case. Totally false/incorrect advertising. Perhaps by the time you read this their product description will have been updated. If not, take my word for it. The people that make it even said it wouldnt fit an ipod.    On another note, the seller was very friendly and offered a refund.",verified
"A small product that gives you a big sound.  My husband loves it, especially for cook-outs!  This is a definite thing to have when you don't want to haul stereo equipment around--just plop the Ipod in and your ready to jam.",verified
