@AmericanAir we're still here guys - you are the worst

@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@AmericanAir How am I supposed to Cancelled Flight it if I can't do it online?  I don't want to lose all the funds on the ticket.  HELP!!! :(
@united please don't take my membership away :(
@united this is atrocious customer service.
@JetBlue is the greatest airline ever üíï‚úàÔ∏èüí∫ #TrueBluePoints #jetbluemember

@AmericanAir your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080.  Been on plane for 7 hrs.  Stop flying broke french planes!
@united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation
@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
"@united @perfectomobile I have to admit that not only the app is good but have lots of useful func (such the ""live"" seat map). Congrats"
"@united cool, thanks."
"@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves."
@united accordingly? U dont respond at all
@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver International Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
"@JetBlue continue button generated a trip to ""plan your trip page""
regardless of how far along I was in Flight Booking Problems process
hint: the end of it"
@united terrible travel experience. Traveled 8000 miles roundtrip but two Cancelled Flightlations of short hops cost me two days
.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
@JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Daily Journal http://t.co/bTb4awQtln
"@united been good 15yr ""friendly skies"" relationship. 2day agent told me I'm ""only Canadian"" and thus not good enough for military preboard"
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80
@USAirways is the @comcast of airlines #2hrs35minOnHold
@SouthwestAir knows whats up! That #BlackHistoryMonth commercial. Just another thing to add to reasons why I fly with #SouthWestAirlines
"@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you üò¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!"
@usairways 2 people working the counter at #dca? Massive lines. Poorly played. #winterstorm
"@JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston"
@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating
@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
"@United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on"
@JetBlue @roxydigital Good. I want extra peanuts on my flight then. lol. #JVMChat
"@united thanks, just sent :)"
"@united A3 Gold. So the international baggage limit apply when booked on 1 ticket,even for a domestic leg?  What if I travel with 2 friends?"
"@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest."
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
@JetBlue How can I check that? I do not believe I was given a credit for that automatically. :/
@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
@AmericanAir I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection!
"@USAirways my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it..."
"@united Okay, thank you for your help :)"
@SouthwestAir You've inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit
@JetBlue you can't beat jetblue in space's matter http://t.co/NRpWmGyv3e
"@AmericanAir attended to and corrected my complaints via Twitter. Whoa. This is the brave, new world we live in. Thank you, American Air :)"
@united Will the airline refuse my Canadian passport with less than 6 months remaining validity? Going to US.
@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/tLGoihqkvS‚Äù üòê make it stop.
"@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service"
@AmericanAir thank you for quick responses.   #aa usually has fantastic customer service. That's why I was so shocked when it wasn't there
@USAirways I just checked in online for tomorrow's flight - thought I should get auto upgrade? (Already got the email saying no seats)
@USAirways Thanks!
"@AmericanAir I sent you a DM, can you please help."
Power Moves RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/t9s68korSN
@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
Sigh... ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/W5NL0AY9Bl‚Äù
"@JetBlue flight 672 delayed from 9:30 to 11:47 now, still sitting on runway over 15 minutes so far. Air travel at its best."
"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
"@united Thanks, I will!"
"@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
"@SouthwestAir big thanks to your team. family emerg, same day ticket, experience was excellent. 1st time flying with yall, not my last!"
"@AmericanAir @united and a complete lack of faith in your companies. It's really a shame that you think telling me ""it's been a challenging"""
@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
@SouthwestAir Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn't part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn't know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat.
@JetBlue hi I flew with your airline once in Australia and saw zero kangaroos. Had this been rectified
".@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?"
@VirginAmerica thanks to your outstanding NYC-JFK crew who moved mountains to get me home to San Francisco tonight!
@SouthwestAir this is ridiculous. It's been 2 hours on hold to rebook Cancelled Flightled flight.
@JetBlue great flight http://t.co/E0R0NTO4TR
.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
"@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy"
@AmericanAir HELP NEEDED ! #complaint ticketed passenger with no available seats scheduled to leave Late Flightr today
@AmericanAir #oaaret is our flight Cancelled Flightled?
@SouthwestAir Big kudos to your staff today at Dallas Love Field for lifting everyone's spirits today with all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations
